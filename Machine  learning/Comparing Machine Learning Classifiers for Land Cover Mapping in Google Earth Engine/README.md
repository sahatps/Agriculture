# üåç Comparing Machine Learning Classifiers for Land Cover Mapping in Google Earth Engine üåç

This is a **web-based application** that compares various machine learning classifiers for **land cover classification** using **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**. The application is built using **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** for satellite data processing and **Colab** for interactive execution.

## üåü **Key Features**
- **Classifier Comparison:** Evaluate six machine learning models on land cover classification:
  - Minimum Distance  
  - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Trees (CART)  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Tree Boosting  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Automatically search for the best Random Forest model using grid search.
- **Accuracy Assessment:** Compute metrics such as overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and confusion matrices.
- **Interactive Map Visualization:** Display classified outputs and Sentinel-2 imagery using **geemap**.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**
- **Colab:** For running Python code interactively in the cloud.
- **Google Earth Engine (ee):** For satellite data acquisition and processing.
- **Geemap:** For interactive visualization of land cover classifications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

### 1. **Authentication with Google Earth Engine:**  
   The notebook uses the **Earth Engine Python API**. Users authenticate using their Google account.

### 2. **Sentinel-2 Image Processing:**  
   Sentinel-2 imagery is filtered based on cloud cover (<20%) and date range. Cloud masking is applied using the **QA60 band**, and a **median composite** is generated for the study area.

### 3. **Training Data Preparation:**  
   Training polygons representing various land cover classes are sampled. Data is split into **70% training** and **30% testing** sets.

### 4. **Classifier Training and Evaluation:**  
   Six machine learning models are trained using the **training data** and evaluated using the **testing data**:
   - Minimum Distance  
   - KNN  
   - SVM  
   - CART  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gradient Tree Boost  

   For each model, metrics such as overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and error matrices are computed.

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Random Forest):**  
   The script uses grid search to find the best combination of parameters for the Random Forest classifier:
   - Number of trees  
   - Variables per split  
   - Minimum leaf population  

   The best model is identified based on overall accuracy.

### 6. **Interactive Visualization:**  
   The classified outputs of each model are visualized on an **interactive map**, with different land cover classes represented by color-coded layers.
